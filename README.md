# Table Taker

Table Taker is a Chrome extension that helps users interact with tables on web pages more efficiently. It allows users to download table data as a CSV file, or upload CSV data to populate form tables directly in the browser.
🚀 Features

    💾 Download tables as CSV with a single click.

    📤 Upload CSV files to populate table-based forms.

    🧠 Intelligent matching of CSV values with table inputs.

    🔒 Fully client-side — no data is collected or sent anywhere.

🔐 Privacy Policy

Table Taker does not collect any personal data.

The extension operates entirely in the browser and uses file input strictly to read values from CSVs to insert into visible tables via the DOM. No external communication, telemetry, or storage of user data occurs.
⚙️ Setup & Usage

    Install the Table Taker extension from the Chrome Web Store (or load it via developer mode if testing locally).

    Navigate to a page with a table.

    Hover over the table to reveal the ⬇ CSV button for downloading its contents.

    Drag a .csv file onto the table to upload values (if the table contains input fields).

✅ That’s it. No additional configuration is needed.
